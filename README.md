## Hi, I'm Sebastian Szczepa≈Ñski!

I have over two years of experience in automated testing in Automotive, virtualization and 4G/5G EPC domains, creating communication tests scenarios, implementing them and keeping high quality of code and documentation. Moreover, recently I have obtained my Master's degree in Data Science specialization at Polish-Japanese Academy of Technology, gaining my knowledge in AI/ML solutions and dealing with data transformation in pipelines.

### There are short descriptions of my projects:
- [Formula 1 Car IoT](https://github.com/SebastianSzczepanski00/Formula_1_Car_IoT) - my leisure time project with docker usage, which consists of two docker containers with bi-directional communication. The project is still under construction.
- [ECG Classification](https://github.com/SebastianSzczepanski00/ECG_Classification) - my engineering thesis source code to process raw ECG signal and save it as features in Pandas Data Frame, next to train Neural Network model to identify person basing on processed ECG signals.
- [Vital Functions Cessation Prediction](https://github.com/SebastianSzczepanski00/Vital_functions_cessation_prediction) - my final project of PJATK "Data Exploration and Visualisation" subject with main purpouse to predict death event via models trained with biometric parameters and patient's habits.
- [Shine Bright Like a Diamond](https://github.com/SebastianSzczepanski00/Shine_bright_like_a_diamond) - my final project of PJATK "Programing for Data Analysis" subject with main purpouse to predict diamonds prices based on theirs parameters.
- [Watch the Road Signs](https://github.com/SebastianSzczepanski00/Watch_the_road_signs) - my final project of PJATK "Introduction to Machine Learning" subject with main purpouse to classify road signs images with Convolutional Neural Network.
