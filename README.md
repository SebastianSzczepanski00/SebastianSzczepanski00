## Hi, I'm Sebastian Szczepański!

I have almost two years of experience in automated testing in virtualization, automotive and 4G/5G EPC domains, creating test scenarios, implementing them and keeping high quality of code and documentation. Moreover on weekends I’m a student of Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology and during my free time I'm constantly developing my Data Science domain skills and performance.

### Here are short descriptions of my projects:
- [ECG Classification](https://github.com/SebastianSzczepanski00/ECG_Classification/tree/main) - my engineering thesis source code to process raw ECG signal and save it as features in Pandas Data Frame, next to train Neural Network model to identify person basing on processed ECG signals.
- [Vital Functions Cessation Prediction](https://github.com/SebastianSzczepanski00/Vital_functions_cessation_prediction) - my final project of PJATK "Data Exploration and Visualisation" subject with main purpouse to predict death event via models trained with biometric parameters and patient's habits.
