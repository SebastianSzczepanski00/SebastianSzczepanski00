## Hi, I'm Sebastian Szczepański!

I have over two years of experience in automated testing in virtualization, automotive and 4G/5G EPC domains, creating test scenarios, implementing them and keeping high quality of code and documentation. Moreover on the weekends I’m a student of Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology and during my free time I'm constantly developing my Data Science domain skills and performance.

### There are short descriptions of my projects:
- [Formula 1 Car IoT](https://github.com/SebastianSzczepanski00/Formula_1_Car_IoT) - my leisure time project with docker usage, which consists of two docker containers with bi-directional communication. The project is still under construction.
- [ECG Classification](https://github.com/SebastianSzczepanski00/ECG_Classification) - my engineering thesis source code to process raw ECG signal and save it as features in Pandas Data Frame, next to train Neural Network model to identify person basing on processed ECG signals.
- [Vital Functions Cessation Prediction](https://github.com/SebastianSzczepanski00/Vital_functions_cessation_prediction) - my final project of PJATK "Data Exploration and Visualisation" subject with main purpouse to predict death event via models trained with biometric parameters and patient's habits.
- [Shine Bright Like a Diamond](https://github.com/SebastianSzczepanski00/Shine_bright_like_a_diamond) - my final project of PJATK "Programing for Data Analysis" subject with main purpouse to predict diamonds prices based on theirs parameters.
- [Watch the Road Signs](https://github.com/SebastianSzczepanski00/Watch_the_road_signs) - my final project of PJATK "Introduction to Machine Learning" subject with main purpouse to classify road signs images with Convolutional Neural Network.
